## Day 1: 28/11/2020
  * On this day I went through _Day 1_ and _Day 2_ of [Angela Yu's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=APPBREWERY).
  I was able to refresh some of the basic python syntax. We ended up creating a "**Band Name Generator**" for Day 1, and a "**Tip Calculator**" for Day 2.
  unfortunately I did't save my code as I was going through those 2 days a bit fast. Overall it was a good fun start.

  ## Day 2: 29/11/2020
  * Today was a fun day, I worked on coding _Day 3_. We had to code a **Treasure Hunt Adventure** story; where the user can pick choices that affects the storyline.
   ### Here is what I did:
   * I was able to create a short story about a "Demon Slayer"
   * I created a while-loop to ask the user if they would like to play again after finishing the game.
   * I created a dictionary for the storyline and choices, which made it easier and cleaner in my opinion

   ### Future thoughts:
   * I think in the future I would create a differnt Module to put the dictionaries in, so the code can look cleaner

  ## Day 3: 30/11/2020:
  * Today I worked on coding _Day 4_. We had to code a **Rock, Paper, Scissor** game; where the user can pick their weapon and then a bot picks a random weapon.
  I decided to create **Rock, Paper, Scicssor, Lizard, Spoke**. It's a game that was inspired from [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/)
   ### Here is what I did:
   * I was able to find some really cool ASCII art that I could use in the project.
   * I was able to create if-statments to print out what user has chosen.
   * I was able to create if-statments to find the winner.
   * I created a while-loop to ask the user if they would like to play again after finishing the game.

   ### Future thoughts:
   * I'd want to add a feature where if user  chooses Rock, and bot chooses Spoke, a print-out prints: "Spoke vaporizes Rock, Bot Wins".
   * I'd like to make the code more organized and easier to read.

   ## Day 4: 1/12/2020:
   * Today I worked on coding _Day 5_. The idea was to create a password generator for the user. The password could contain letters, numbers, and symbols based on what the user    wants. Sadly, I was not able to finish this project today because of **LIFE**. So stay tuned for tomorrow.

   ## Day 5: 1/12/2020
   * I was able to finish the password generator. I still have a lot of ideas to add to it later on in the future.
   ### Here is what I did:
   * I was able to create a string from a list using the ''.join
   * I was able to randomise the position of the letters/numbers/symbols of that string.
   
   ### Things I want to add:
   * I'd like to create a GUI for this code
   * I would like to add a while loop to ask user if he wants another password
   * If user enters a value != int -> then show an error and ask them to type an int
   
   ### Challenge for my self:
   * This is something I don't know how to approach at all. But copying the result password to the clipboard right away would be a great addition.

  ## Day 6: 2/12/2020:
  * Today I worked on coding _Day 6_. We had to code a robot to escape a maze; [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html). In the beginning the challenge was simple. But the final maze was indeed a little tricky.
   ### Here is what I did:
   * Allowed the robot to move safetly to the end of the maze
   * Used while-loops and functions to ease the process

 ## Day 7: 3/12/2020:
  * Today I worked on coding _Day 7_. We were supposed to create a **Hangman Game**. I was never really into those games since I always ended up dead.
  In the end, it was a fun experiment.
  
  ### Here is what I did:
   * Learned a lot about array/list maniplulation.
   
   ### Future thoughts:
   * I'd want to be able to clear the run console in pycharm so the game doesn't get too crowded.

   ## Day 8: 04/12/2020
  * Today I worked on coding _Day 8_. We had to code **Ceasar's Cipher**. This by far was the most challenging day for me. The logic behind this had me sitting down looking at the screen like a zombie. with a lot of fails and tries and lots of googling, I was finally able to finish the code and understand it.
   ### Here is what I did:
   * I learned to actaully sit down, and start writing down the logic of what I want to happen step by step.
   * Learned how to use the remainder in a very cool way (line 21)
   * Learned how to get the index of an element from a list
   ### Future thoughts:
   * The remainder was used to help if someone chose a high shifted number, but it doesn't work when it equals 0, So I would like to find an alternative.
