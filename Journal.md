## Day 1: 28/11/2020
  * On this day I went through _Day 1_ and _Day 2_ of [Angela Yu's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=APPBREWERY).
  I was able to refresh some of the basic python syntax. We ended up creating a "**Band Name Generator**" for Day 1, and a "**Tip Calculator**" for Day 2.
  unfortunately I did't save my code as I was going through those 2 days a bit fast. Overall it was a good fun start.

  ## Day 2: 29/11/2020
   * Today was a fun day, I worked on coding _Day 3_. We had to code a **Treasure Hunt Adventure** story; where the user can pick choices that affects the storyline.
   ### Here is what I did:
   * I was able to create a short story about a "Demon Slayer"
   * I created a while-loop to ask the user if they would like to play again after finishing the game.
   * I created a dictionary for the storyline and choices, which made it easier and cleaner in my opinion

   ### Future thoughts:
   * I think in the future I would create a differnt Module to put the dictionaries in, so the code can look cleaner

  ## Day 3: 30/11/2020
     * Today I worked on coding _Day 4_. We had to code a **Rock, Paper, Scissor** game; where the user can pick their weapon and then a bot picks a random weapon.
     I decided to create **Rock, Paper, Scicssor, Lizard, Spoke**. It's a game that was inspired from [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/)
   ### Here is what I did:
   * I was able to find some really cool ASCII art that I could use in the project.
   * I was able to create if-statments to print out what user has chosen.
   * I was able to create if-statments to find the winner.
   * I created a while-loop to ask the user if they would like to play again after finishing the game.

   ### Future thoughts:
   * I'd want to add a feature where if user  chooses Rock, and bot chooses Spoke, a print-out prints: "Spoke vaporizes Rock, Bot Wins".
   * I'd like to make the code more organized and easier to read.
