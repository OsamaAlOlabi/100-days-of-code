# 100 days of python code


Today, on 28/11/2020, I've participated in the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge made by [Angela Yu's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=APPBREWERY).

I won't exactly follow the official rules as I have some past experience with python coding. So I might do 1+ project a day, or it might take me a bit longer to finish one project. I always try to create my own touch into the project, and sometimes that can get a little complicated which can lead me taking more time to finish one.

I'll try to keep this repository updated whenever I can. You can find the projects that I worked on in my [***journal***](https://github.com/OsamaAlOlabi/100-days-of-python-code/blob/main/Journal.md).
